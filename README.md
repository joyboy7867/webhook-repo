# ðŸ”” GitHub Actions Webhook Tracker

This project is a **GitHub Webhook Integration System** built with Flask and MongoDB, designed to track and display events from a connected GitHub repository in real-time.

It captures three key GitHub actions:
- âœ… `Push`
- âœ… `Pull Request`
- âœ… `Merge`

These events are received via a webhook endpoint, stored in MongoDB, and displayed in a clean, minimalistic frontend that auto-updates every 15 seconds.
